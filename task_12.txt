Hey @everyone let's start exploring AWS SQS service... As we used Redis PubSub, SQS is a queue system...

Let's create a simple hello world msg system, create a producer and a consumer...

Use boto3 package in python to connect to your AWS accounts...

Post doubts on ‚Å†b-1-tech-doubts , I'll setup a doubt call also this weekend.

Use a Standard SQS queue and not FIFO
