TASK 2

1. Start learning MongoDB - https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/introduction/

2. Spin up a FREE FOREVER cluster on MongoDB Atlas (MongoDB Cloud) to learn and test your hands-on exercises - 
https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/getting-started/

3. What are Databases, Collections, Documents? https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/databases-and-collections/

IMP: Do not learn about Views, Capped Collections and Clustered Collections.

4. Basic CRUD operations - https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/crud/
    Important to see syntax, and then the examples...

5. Learn about Query Operators (How to use and when to use) - https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/

This is just the basics, the tip of the iceberg (5%) of MongoDB. Just learn it native to MongoDB (run commands via MongoDB Shell, 
directly on MongoDB Atlas or use MongoDB Compass)
